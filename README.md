# dotfiles-public
my linux config files that are actually public

i use nixos as my chosen distro (i like it a lot even if i refuse to learn what a flake is or how homemanager works), and my configuration has been included here with heavy redactions.

i use sway as my WM and ly as my DM. these are configured in both nixos/packages.nix as well as sway/ and swaylock/. kitty is my terminal emulator, although i am known to be a fan of foot.

i use newsboat as my rss reader [because everyone should have one](https://roseis.gay/blog/rss).

helix is my editor of choice. it has a few things missing that i want, but i FAR prefer the select -> action model and its default keymap.

i use fish as my shell, with very little configuration besides integrating yazi, and abbreviations (most of which are redacted)

i have one script that i use right now, transcript.py. i stole parts of it from somewhere on reddit (i cant remember the author sorry).
